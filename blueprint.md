# Firebase CRUD Issue Investigation Plan

This document outlines the steps to diagnose and resolve the reported Firebase CRUD issue.

## 1. Understand the Firebase Setup
- **Review `src/services/firebase.ts`**: Check the Firebase initialization and configuration.
- **Review `.env` and `.env.example`**: Verify that all necessary environment variables are present and correctly configured.

## 2. Analyze the Data Service
- **Examine `src/services/firebaseDataService.ts`**: This is likely where the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic resides. I will look for potential issues in the implementation of these functions.
- **Check related hooks**: Hooks like `useFirebaseTackleBox.ts` might be using `firebaseDataService.ts` and could reveal how data is being managed.

## 3. Investigate Component-Level Usage
- **Review components**: I will examine components that are using the Firebase services and hooks, such as `TripFormModal.tsx`, `FishCatchModal.tsx`, and `TackleBoxModal.tsx`. This will help me understand how the CRUD operations are being called and how the UI interacts with the data layer.

## 4. Identify the Root Cause
- Based on the findings from the previous steps, I will formulate a hypothesis for the root cause of the issue. This could be anything from a configuration error to a logic bug in one of the CRUD functions.

## 5. Propose and Implement a Fix
- Once the root cause is identified, I will propose a solution.
- After approval, I will implement the fix and verify that it resolves the issue.
