# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has an issue where orphaned weather logs and fish caught data can be uploaded to Firestore during the login process without being associated with any trips. This creates data inconsistency and prevents the calendar from displaying properly even when data exists in Firestore. The system needs to detect and handle orphaned data appropriately to maintain data integrity and provide a consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want orphaned weather logs and fish caught data to be automatically cleaned up during login, so that my calendar displays correctly and doesn't contain inconsistent data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL detect any weather logs or fish caught records that are not associated with existing trips
2. WHEN orphaned data is detected THEN the system SHALL remove these records from both local storage and Firestore
3. WHEN orphaned data cleanup is performed THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup actions for debugging purposes
4. IF no orphaned data exists THEN the system SHALL proceed normally without any cleanup actions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified when orphaned data cleanup occurs, so that I understand why some data might be missing and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orphaned data is cleaned up THEN the system SHALL display a notification to the user explaining what happened
2. WHEN the notification is shown THEN it SHALL include the count of orphaned records that were removed
3. WHEN the notification is displayed THEN it SHALL provide guidance on how to prevent this issue in the future
4. IF the user dismisses the notification THEN it SHALL not appear again for the current session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of orphaned data detection and cleanup, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orphaned data detection runs THEN the system SHALL log the total counts of weather logs and fish caught records being checked
2. WHEN orphaned records are found THEN the system SHALL log the specific record IDs and their details
3. WHEN cleanup operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log success or failure for each operation
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL log a summary of all actions taken

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to prevent orphaned data creation in the first place, so that cleanup operations are rarely needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather logs or fish caught data is created THEN the system SHALL ensure it is always associated with a valid trip
2. WHEN a trip is deleted THEN the system SHALL also delete all associated weather logs and fish caught records
3. WHEN data merge operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate data relationships before uploading to Firestore
4. IF invalid data relationships are detected during merge THEN the system SHALL reject the problematic records and log the issue
