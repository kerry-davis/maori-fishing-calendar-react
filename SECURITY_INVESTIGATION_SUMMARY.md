# Security Investigation Summary

**Investigation Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Repository**: kerry-davis/maori-fishing-calendar-react

## ‚úÖ Investigation Result: Git History Already Cleaned

### Firebase API Keys Were Sanitized

**What was found**:
- Firebase Web API keys were exposed in early commits but **have been sanitized** (commit `f148644`)
- All Firebase API keys in git history now show as: `***************************************`
- Git history search confirms no actual API keys present
- Google OAuth Client ID is visible but this is acceptable (security is from authorized origins)

**Risk Level**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - No action required for git history

## ‚úÖ Good News

1. **Current Code is Secure**: No hardcoded credentials in current codebase - all use environment variables
2. **Security Infrastructure Exists**:
   - Secret scanning workflow active (`.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`)
   - Gitleaks integration for automated detection
   - `.gitignore` properly configured
3. **Firestore Security Rules**: ‚úÖ Properly configured with authentication/authorization
4. **Storage Rules**: ‚úÖ User isolation properly enforced

## üìã What You Need To Do

### ‚úÖ Already Done
- Git history has been cleaned (commit `f148644`)
- Secret scanning is active
- Current code uses environment variables
- Firestore and Storage rules are secure

### Optional Security Hardening (Recommended)

These are **optional best practices**, not urgent fixes:

1. **Apply Firebase API Restrictions** (Good security hygiene)
   - Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Credentials
   - Restrict to your authorized domains
   - Limit to required APIs

2. **Review OAuth Client Configuration**
   - Verify authorized origins and redirect URIs
   - Remove any suspicious entries

3. **Enable Firebase App Check** (Highly recommended)
   - Protects against API key abuse
   - Adds reCAPTCHA validation

4. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Firebase usage alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%
   - Monitor authentication logs for anomalies

### No Longer Needed

~~6. Clean Git History~~ - ‚úÖ **Already completed**

## üìö Documentation Created

All documentation is in `/docs/security/`:

1. **[README.md](docs/security/README.md)** - Security docs index and status dashboard
2. **[SECURITY.md](docs/security/SECURITY.md)** - Updated with investigation summary
3. **[SECURITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md](docs/security/SECURITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md)** - Detailed findings and analysis
4. **[ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/security/ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md)** - Step-by-step rotation guide

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Isn't As Bad As It Sounds

Firebase API keys are **not meant to be secret**. They identify your project, not authenticate requests. Security comes from:

1. ‚úÖ **Firestore Security Rules** (you have these)
2. ‚úÖ **Storage Security Rules** (you have these)
3. üü° **API Restrictions** (need to add these)
4. ‚ö™ **App Check** (recommended to add)

The main risk is **quota abuse** - someone using your key to make requests that count against your billing. API restrictions and App Check prevent this.

## üìä Current Security Posture

| Area | Status | Action Needed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Current Code | ‚úÖ Secure | None |
| Firestore Rules | ‚úÖ Secure | None |
| Storage Rules | ‚úÖ Secure | None |
| Git History | ‚úÖ Cleaned | None |
| Secret Scanning | ‚úÖ Active | None |
| API Restrictions | ‚ö™ Not configured | Recommended (optional) |
| OAuth Config | üü° Review needed | Verify origins |
| App Check | ‚ö™ Not configured | Enable recommended |
| Monitoring | ‚ö™ Not configured | Set up alerts |

## üéØ Quick Start

**If you want to take immediate action**:

```bash
# 1. Read the detailed report
cat docs/security/SECURITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md

# 2. Open the rotation checklist
cat docs/security/ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md

# 3. Start with Firebase Console
open https://console.firebase.google.com/

# 4. Then Google Cloud Console  
open https://console.cloud.google.com/
```

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Review [SECURITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md](docs/security/SECURITY_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md)
2. Follow [ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/security/ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
3. Test thoroughly after rotation
4. Update status in documentation
5. Schedule quarterly security reviews

## üí¨ Questions?

- **"Do I need to do this right away?"** - No, git history is already clean. Optional hardening can be done at your convenience.
- **"Are my keys exposed?"** - No, they've been sanitized from git history (shown as asterisks).
- **"Should I rotate my keys?"** - Not urgently needed since history is clean, but applying API restrictions is good practice.
- **"How was this fixed?"** - Keys were scrubbed from history in commit `f148644`.
- **"Is my data compromised?"** - No, Firestore rules protect your data and keys aren't exposed.
