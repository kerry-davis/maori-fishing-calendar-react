# üöÄ Migrate Your MƒÅori Fishing Calendar Data

**Congratulations!** Your legacy app data can be successfully migrated to the new React version.

## ‚úÖ Migration Status: **READY**

I've analyzed your legacy app and created a complete migration solution. Here's what you need to know:

## üìä What Gets Migrated

‚úÖ **Fishing Trips** - All your trip logs with dates, locations, companions, and notes
‚úÖ **Weather Data** - Weather observations for each trip
‚úÖ **Fish Catches** - All fish caught with species, size, gear used, and photos
‚úÖ **Tackle Box** - Your fishing gear and equipment
‚úÖ **Settings** - Theme preferences and location data
‚úÖ **Photos** - All fishing photos with automatic format detection and size optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Methods

### **Method 1: Quick Migration (Recommended)**

1. **Export from Legacy App:**
   ```javascript
   // Open your legacy app in browser
   // Open DevTools Console (F12)
   // Run: exportMigrationData()
   // Copy the JSON data that appears
   ```

2. **Import to React App:**
   ```javascript
   // Open your React app in browser
   // Open DevTools Console
   // Paste your exported data and run:
   // await window.firebaseDataService.migrateLocalData(yourData);
   ```

### **Method 1B: Zip File Migration (Easiest)**

1. **Export Zip from Legacy App:**
   - Open your legacy MƒÅori Fishing Calendar app
   - Click the "Export Data" button
   - Save the downloaded `.zip` file to your computer

2. **Import Zip to React App:**
   ```bash
   # Set the path to your zip file in the script:
   # Edit scripts/import-zip-migration.js
   const ZIP_FILE_PATH = "/path/to/your/exported_file.zip";

   # Run the import script:
   node scripts/import-zip-migration.js
   ```

### **Method 2: Using Migration Scripts**

I've created these scripts for you:

- `scripts/migrate-from-legacy.js` - Extracts data from legacy app
- `scripts/import-legacy-data.js` - Imports data into React app
- `scripts/import-zip-migration.js` - **NEW: Import zip files directly**
- `scripts/test-legacy-migration.js` - Tests the migration process

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Export Your Legacy Data
1. Open your legacy MƒÅori Fishing Calendar app
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Console
3. Copy and paste the migration script:
   ```javascript
   // Load migration script
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'http://localhost:8000/migrate-from-legacy.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```
4. After it loads, run:
   ```javascript
   exportMigrationData();
   ```
5. Copy all the JSON data that appears in the console

### Step 2: Import to React App
1. Open your React MƒÅori Fishing Calendar app
2. Sign up/login to create a user account
3. The app will automatically detect local data and show a migration prompt
4. Click "Migrate Data" to import your legacy data

### Step 3: Verify Migration
- Check that all your trips appear in the calendar
- Verify fish catches and weather logs are preserved
- **Confirm photos are migrated** - Look for fish photos in the gallery
- Confirm tackle box items are migrated
- Test creating new data to ensure everything works

### Step 4: Photo Verification
- Open the photo gallery in the React app
- Verify all your fishing photos are visible
- Check photo quality and details are preserved
- Confirm photos are properly associated with fish catches

## üì∏ Photo Migration Details

The migration system provides **comprehensive photo support**:

### **Photo Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic format detection** (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- ‚úÖ **Base64 preservation** - maintains original quality
- ‚úÖ **Size analysis** - reports photo data statistics
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - gracefully handles corrupted photos
- ‚úÖ **Gallery integration** - photos appear in React app gallery

### **Photo Storage:**
- **Legacy Format**: Base64 encoded images in IndexedDB
- **React Format**: Same base64 format (compatible)
- **File Size**: All sizes supported (analyzed during migration)
- **Quality**: Original quality preserved

### **Photo Migration Process:**
1. **Detection** - Identifies base64 encoded photos
2. **Validation** - Verifies photo data integrity
3. **Processing** - Extracts and preserves image data
4. **Transfer** - Moves to React app with full quality
5. **Verification** - Confirms photos display correctly

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If migration doesn't start automatically:**
- Use the manual import method shown above
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure you're logged into the React app

**If data doesn't appear:**
- Refresh the React app after migration
- Check that you're looking at the correct date range
- Verify the user account has the migrated data

**If photos don't appear:**
- Check the photo gallery specifically
- Verify photo file sizes aren't too large
- Look for photo-related errors in browser console
- Confirm photos were base64 encoded in the legacy app

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the migration** with a small amount of sample data first
2. **Backup your legacy app data** before full migration
3. **Perform the migration** using your preferred method
4. **Verify all data** has been successfully migrated
5. **Start using the React app** with all your historical data!
