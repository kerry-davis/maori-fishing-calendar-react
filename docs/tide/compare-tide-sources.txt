# Tide Services Comparison for Kawhia, NZ  (Wed 15 Oct 2025)

## METSERVICE (Reference - Gold Standard)
- HIGH: 05:30 (2.9m)
- LOW: 11:22 (1.3m) 
- HIGH: 18:09 (3.0m)
*Source: MetOcean Solutions, NZ-specific corrections*

## MAREA API (From your console logs)
- HIGH: 03:33 (0.89m) ❌
- LOW: 10:02 (-0.83m) ❌  
- HIGH: 16:13 (0.69m) ❌
*Source: FES2014 global model, 6km from target location*
*Differences: Wrong times, wrong heights, negative low tides*

## OPEN-METEO (Need to test)
- TODO: Get actual data from current app
*Source: Global marine weather API*

## ANALYSIS

### Marea Issues:
1. **Location Accuracy**: Using coordinates 6km away from Kawhia
2. **Model Limitation**: FES2014 global model vs local NZ corrections
3. **No Harbor Corrections**: Missing local bathymetry and harbor effects
4. **Heights**: Significantly lower than expected (0.89m vs 2.9m)
5. **Timing**: Off by 1-2 hours from MetService

### Expected Open-Meteo:
- Should be in the 2-3m range for high tides like MetService
- Times should be closer to MetService than Marea
- Global model but may have better NZ coverage

### RECOMMENDATIONS:
If Open-Meteo is closer to MetService values, use it as primary.
If both global models are inaccurate, we may need NZ-specific data.
