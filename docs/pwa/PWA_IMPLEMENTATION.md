  - Proper error handling and fallbacks for testing

#### 3. PWA UI Components
- **Files**:
  - `src/features/pwa/PWAInstallPrompt.tsx`
  - `src/features/pwa/PWAUpdateNotification.tsx`
  - `src/features/pwa/OfflineIndicator.tsx`
  - `src/features/pwa/SyncToast.tsx`

- **Features**:
  - Install prompt with dismiss functionality
  - Update notification with reload option
  - Offline status indicator
  - Responsive design matching app theme

#### 4. Service Worker Configuration
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - App shell caching for offline functionality

  - Proper app name and description
  - Icon configuration (192x192, 512x512)
  - Theme and background colors
  - Standalone display mode
  - Portrait orientation preference

#### 6. Testing Implementation
- **Coverage**: 
  - Install prompt functionality
  - Update notification behavior
  - Offline indicator display
  - PWA context state management

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

#### Service Worker Features
- **Auto-update**: Configured with prompt mode for user control
- **Offline Support**: Caches essential app resources
- **External Resources**: Caches CDN resources with appropriate strategies
- **API Caching**: Weather API responses cached for offline access

#### Install Prompt
- **Event Handling**: Captures beforeinstallprompt event
- **User Control**: Shows/hides based on browser support
- **Dismissible**: Users can dismiss or install
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

#### Update Notifications
- **Service Worker Updates**: Detects when new version is available
- **User Choice**: Allows users to update immediately or later
- **Offline Ready**: Notifies when app is ready for offline use

#### Offline Support
- **Status Detection**: Monitors online/offline status
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows offline banner when disconnected
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work offline

### 📋 Requirements Verification

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Service worker generated for offline functionality
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: App continues to work with cached resources when offline  
✅ **Requirement 6.3**: App remains installable as PWA on mobile devices
✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Manifest maintains all existing PWA configuration

### 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ PWA behavior covered by integration suites (e.g. auth login/logout flows, encryption UI, offline UX)
- ✅ Context and hook usage exercised in app-level tests
- ✅ Update and install prompts validated in UI flows
- ✅ Offline indicator visibility validated under network toggles

### 🚀 Production Ready

The PWA implementation is complete and production-ready with:
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Responsive UI components
- Optimized caching strategies
- User-friendly install and update flows

### 📝 Usage

The PWA components are automatically included in the main App component:
- Install prompts appear when supported by browser
- Update notifications show when new versions are available
- Offline indicators appear when network is unavailable
- Service worker handles caching automatically

All PWA functionality is integrated into the existing app architecture and follows the same patterns as other components.
