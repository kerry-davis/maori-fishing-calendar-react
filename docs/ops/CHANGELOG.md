# Changelog

## Latest Updates

- Firestore rules: owner-guarded get/update/delete; explicit list permissions for trips, weatherLogs, fishCaught, tackleItems, gearTypes; allow userSettings delete by owner (covers legacy docs without userId); helper functions for standardized checks.
- Import/Export: include encrypted photos in exports; improved import progress; fetch catches by trip; robust guestâ†’cloud merge via upsert; complete delete-all wipe (enc_photos + tackle/gear/userSettings).
- PWA/Offline UX: new `SyncToast` and refreshed `OfflineIndicator`; shared sync status across UI; safer logout waiting for pending sync.
- Services/Utilities: updated `firebaseDataService`, `dataExportService`, `browserZipImportService`; added `imageCompression`; improved photo preview utilities.
- Docs: updated Firebase Storage CORS guide; expanded migration guide for browser-based zip import; troubleshooting notes for distinguishing Storage 403 vs CORS.

- Introduced a shared sync status context that keeps connectivity, queue length, and last-sync timestamps in sync across the UI for clearer offline workflows.
- Added a guarded logout flow that waits for pending sync activity (with retry and override options) before signing users out.
- Hardened modal handling around PWA authentication redirects to prevent unintended settings screens from opening post-login.

### Recent
- Testing: CI-only exclusions for known-flaky integration suites; reproduce locally with `CI=1 npm run test:run` (see vitest.config.ts).
- AuthContext: added robust timer and listener cleanup; stabilized previous-user tracking for background operations in tests.
- Hooks: `useModalWithCleanup` now relies solely on `uid` (removed legacy `user.id`).
- Data Service: encrypted photo storage returns `{ photoUrl: '' }` and `encryptedMetadata`; clients fetch URLs on demand.
- Utils: `clearUserContext` uses a typed `WeakMap` with a dedicated guest key to avoid null issues; improved persistent cleanup logging.
 - Data-loss guardrail: Fish catch updates preserve existing photos by default. Photo removal now requires explicit signal (`photo: ''`/`photoPath: ''`/`photoUrl: ''` or `removePhoto: true`). Updates by omission no longer clear photo fields.
