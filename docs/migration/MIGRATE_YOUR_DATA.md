- `scripts/import-zip-migration.js` - Import zip files with Node.js
- `src/shared/services/browserZipImportService.ts` - **NEW: Browser-based zip import (mobile-friendly)**
- `scripts/test-legacy-migration.js` - Tests the migration process

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Export Your Legacy Data
1. Open your legacy MƒÅori Fishing Calendar app
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Console
3. Copy and paste the migration script:
   ```javascript
   // Load migration script
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'http://localhost:8000/migrate-from-legacy.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```
4. After it loads, run:
   ```javascript
   exportMigrationData();
   ```
5. Copy all the JSON data that appears in the console

### Step 2: Import to React App
1. Open your React MƒÅori Fishing Calendar app
2. Sign up/login to create a user account
3. The app will automatically detect local data and show a migration prompt
4. Click "Migrate Data" to import your legacy data

### Step 3: Verify Migration
- Check that all your trips appear in the calendar
- Verify fish catches and weather logs are preserved
- **Confirm photos are migrated** - Look for fish photos in the gallery
- Confirm tackle box items are migrated
- Test creating new data to ensure everything works

### Step 4: Photo Verification
- Open the photo gallery in the React app
- Verify all your fishing photos are visible
- Check photo quality and details are preserved
- Confirm photos are properly associated with fish catches

## üì∏ Photo Migration Details

The migration system provides **comprehensive photo support**:

### **Photo Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic format detection** (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- ‚úÖ **Size optimization preset** ‚Äî images are standardized to max 1080px on the longest side at ~0.85 JPEG quality
- ‚úÖ **Size analysis** ‚Äî reports photo data statistics
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - gracefully handles corrupted photos
- ‚úÖ **Gallery integration** - photos appear in React app gallery

### **Photo Storage & Optimization:**
- **Legacy Format**: Base64 encoded images in IndexedDB
- **React Format**: Optimized data URLs (JPEG, 1080px @ 0.85) for import; uploaded photos use the same preset before encryption
- **File Size**: All sizes supported; compressed on import for faster loads and smaller backups
- **Quality**: Visually preserved with lossy compression tuned for photos

### **Photo Migration Process:**
1. **Detection** - Identifies base64 encoded photos
2. **Validation** - Verifies photo data integrity
3. **Processing** - Extracts and preserves image data
4. **Transfer** - Moves to React app with full quality
5. **Verification** - Confirms photos display correctly

## üì± Mobile Migration Guide

### **Perfect for Tablets and Phones!**

If you're migrating on a mobile device or tablet, use the **browser-based zip import** method:

1. **On Mobile/Tablet:**
   - Open your React app in the mobile browser
   - Sign up/login to your account
   - The migration modal will appear automatically
   - Choose **"Import from Zip File Instead"**
   - Upload your zip file directly in the browser

2. **No Installation Required:**
   - ‚úÖ Works on iOS Safari
   - ‚úÖ Works on Android Chrome
   - ‚úÖ Works on tablets
   - ‚úÖ No app installation needed
   - ‚úÖ No Node.js or terminal access required

3. **Mobile-Specific Features:**
   - Touch-friendly file upload interface
   - Progress indicators during import
   - Clear error messages for troubleshooting
   - Automatic format detection (JSON/CSV)
   - Photo extraction and processing

### **Mobile Troubleshooting:**
- **File too large?** The browser handles large zip files automatically
- **Slow import?** Normal on mobile networks - the import will complete
- **Browser crashes?** Refresh and try again - progress is saved
- **Can't find zip file?** Check your Downloads folder

## üë§ Guest vs Authenticated Import

### **Guest User Import (Offline):**
- ‚úÖ **No account required** - import works immediately
- ‚úÖ **Local storage** - data saves to browser's IndexedDB
- ‚úÖ **Instant access** - view your data right away
- ‚úÖ **Auto-migration** - when you create/login to account, data uploads to cloud
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for testing** - try the app with your data before committing

### **Authenticated User Import (Online):**
- ‚úÖ **Cloud storage** - data saves to your Firebase account
- ‚úÖ **Cross-device sync** - access data on any device
- ‚úÖ **Real-time backup** - data is safely stored in the cloud
- ‚úÖ **Multi-device support** - seamless sync across devices

### **Auto-Migration Process:**
1. **Import as guest** ‚Üí Data saves locally
2. **Create account later** ‚Üí App detects local data
3. **Automatic upload** ‚Üí Local data migrates to cloud
4. **Complete sync** ‚Üí All devices have access to your data

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If migration doesn't start automatically:**
- Use the manual import method shown above
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure you're logged into the React app

**If data doesn't appear:**
- Refresh the React app after migration
- Check that you're looking at the correct date range
- Verify the user account has the migrated data

**If photos don't appear:**
- Check the photo gallery specifically
- Verify photo file sizes aren't too large
- Look for photo-related errors in browser console
- Confirm photos were base64 encoded in the legacy app
