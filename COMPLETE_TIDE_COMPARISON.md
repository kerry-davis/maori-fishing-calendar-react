## ACCURACY ANALYSIS

### üèÜ METSERVICE (Reference) - 100% Accuracy
- **Perfect accuracy** - Official NZ harbor predictions
- **Local corrections** applied for Kawhia Harbor
- **MetOcean Solutions** expertise

### ü•à OPEN-METEO (Current Primary) - POOR ACCURACY ‚ùå
**Time Differences:**
- First High: 05:30 (MetService) vs 03:00 (Open-Meteo) = **2h 30min early**
- Low: 11:22 (MetService) vs 10:00 (Open-Meteo) = **1h 22min early**
- Second High: 18:09 (MetService) vs 16:00 (Open-Meteo) = **2h 9min early**

**Height Differences:**
- First High: 2.9m (MetService) vs 1.15m (Open-Meteo) = **1.75m UNDER (60% error)**
- Low: 1.3m (MetService) vs -0.52m (Open-Meteo) = **1.82m UNDER (and NEGATIVE!)**
- Second High: 3.0m (MetService) vs 1.26m (Open-Meteo) = **1.74m UNDER (58% error)**

**Open-Meteo Issues:**
- **Severe Height Underestimation**: 58-60% error
- **Consistently Early**: 1.5-2.5 hours early
- **Wrong Tide Patterns**: Negative low tides vs actual positive

### ü•â MAREA API (Previous Tests) - POOR ACCURACY ‚ùå
**Time Differences:**
- First High: 05:30 (MetService) vs 03:33 (Marea) = **1h 57min early**
- Low: 11:22 (MetService) vs 10:02 (Marea) = **1h 20min early**
- Second High: 18:09 (MetService) vs 16:13 (Marea) = **1h 56min early**

**Height Differences:**
- First High: 2.9m (MetService) vs 0.89m (Marea) = **2.01m UNDER (69% error)**
- Low: 1.3m (MetService) vs -0.83m (Marea) = **2.13m UNDER (and NEGATIVE!)**
- Second High: 3.0m (MetService) vs 0.69m (Marea) = **2.31m UNDER (77% error)**

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**Both Open-Meteo and Marea API are dangerously inaccurate for NZ harbor fishing!**

### Problems Identified:
1. **Height Errors**: 58-77% underestimation (1.7-2.3m off!)
2. **Timing Errors**: Always 1.5-2.5 hours early
3. **Wrong Tide Patterns**: Showing negative low tides when actual is +1.3m
4. **Global Model Limitations**: Neither has proper NZ harbor corrections
5. **Fishing Safety Risk**: Would show low tide during actual high tide

### IMPACT ON FISHING:
- **Wrong timing windows** for fishing activities
- **Incorrect depth predictions** for boat navigation
- **Misleading tide charts** for planning
- **Potential safety hazards** for harbor operations

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
1. **Neither Open-Meteo nor Marea suitable** for NZ harbor fishing
2. **Need NZ-specific tide data** with local harbor corrections
3. **Current implementation is dangerously misleading**

### üîç POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
1. **Investigate MetService API** if they offer programmatic access
2. **LINZ official tide data** (but had CORS issues)
3. **Find NZ-specific tide APIs** with harbor corrections
4. **Stick to original tide service** until better NZ data source found

### üìä ACCURACY RANKING:
1. **ü•á MetService** - 100% (gold standard, but no API access found)
2. **ü•Ñ Open-Meteo** - ~42% (slightly better timing than Marea)
3. **ü•â Marea API** - ~30% (worst overall accuracy)

## CONCLUSION
The current tide integration is **not suitable for production use** in NZ fishing applications. Global tide models without local harbor corrections provide dangerously inaccurate predictions that could mislead anglers and potentially create safety hazards.

**URGENT**: Need to find NZ-specific tide data source or implement manual harbor corrections for accurate fishing planning.
