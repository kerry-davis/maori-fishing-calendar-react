# Phase 5 — iteration 3: modified files summary

Short list of files/artefacts added/updated during Phase 5 iteration 3 and brief purpose:

- `scripts/migrate-legacy-photos.js` — Full migration runner implementation (dry-run by default) that fetches inline or storage photos, optionally encrypts with a provided AES-256-GCM key, uploads to `enc_photos` paths with storage metadata, updates Firestore documents, and persists resumable progress and per-photo outcomes.
- `scripts/configure-firebase.js` — (previously added) admin SDK initialization helper used by the migration runner.

Notes:
- The migration runner supports `--dry-run`, `--encrypt-key` (base64), `--filter-user`, `--batch-size`, and writes progress to a JSON file for resume/retry.
- It is the operator's responsibility to run the script with appropriate credentials and with a tested encryption key approach. See script headers for guidance.
