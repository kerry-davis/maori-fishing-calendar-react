3. Capture the latest sync timestamp and in-flight status from the data/auth layers, ensuring the information is exposed via context or service hooks.
4. Persist and update the sync metadata so the UI can react to completion or ongoing operations in real time.
5. Enhance the sign-out confirmation to display the last-sync timestamp, show a progress indicator while sync runs, and block confirmation until the process completes or a timeout is reached.
6. Handle timeout or failure scenarios by offering retry guidance and gracefully re-enabling sign-out when appropriate.
7. Create `.tasks/feature/guest-user-admin.files11.md` summarizing modified files.
