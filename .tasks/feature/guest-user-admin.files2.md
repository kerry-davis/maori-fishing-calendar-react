## Modified Files

- `src/services/firebaseDataService.ts`: Updated guest write call sites to use revised helper and correct operation tokens.
- `src/components/Modals/TripLogModal.tsx`: Restored fish preview rendering by honoring `photo`, `photoUrl`, and `photoPath` while skipping empty placeholders.
