# Phase 7 — iteration 2: modified files summary

Short list of files changed during Phase 7 iteration 2:

- `src/components/Modals/GalleryModal.tsx` — Restrict object URL revocation to unmount-only for lifecycle cleanup.
- `src/components/Modals/FishCatchModal.tsx` — Retain persisted `photoPath` when loading encrypted catches; convert decrypted photo payloads into blob URLs for `photoPreview`; replaced window service access with direct import.

Notes:
- Gallery and edit modals now handle encrypted photo lifecycle and cleanup robustly.
- Decrypted photos are surfaced as blob URLs for safe preview and memory management.
- All modal service access is now typed and imported directly.
- Relevant tests and linters re-run; see output for details.
