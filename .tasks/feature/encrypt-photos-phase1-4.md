# Phase 1 Tasks for feature/encrypt-photos (Iteration 4)

1. /home/pulsta/vscode/repo/maori-fishing-calendar-react
2. .tasks/long_running_tooling.md
3. Remove the duplicated 
   "should handle binary format creation and parsing" and
   "should reject invalid binary format" tests from `src/test/photoEncryption.test.ts`, retaining a single copy of each.
4. Run `npm test` (or `npm run test:run`) to confirm the suite passes once duplicates are removed.
5. Create `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase1.files4.md` listing the modified files in short form.
