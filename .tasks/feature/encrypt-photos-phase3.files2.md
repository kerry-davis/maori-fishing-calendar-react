# Phase 3 — iteration 2: modified files summary

Short list of files changed during Phase 3 iteration 2 and brief purpose:

- `src/components/Modals/GalleryModal.tsx` — Preserve `fishId` as a string in `PhotoItem` (removed `parseInt`) so IDs remain unique and stable.
- `src/components/Modals/SearchModal.tsx` — Updated `onFishSelect` signature to accept `fishId` as `string` and ensure callsites pass string IDs.

Notes:
- This iteration makes `fishId` consistent as a string across gallery-related UI to avoid collisions and preserve unique identifiers when IDs are non-numeric or large.
