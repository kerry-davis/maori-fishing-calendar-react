# Phase 5 — iteration 1: modified files summary

Short list of files/artefacts added or touched during Phase 5 iteration 1 and brief purpose:

- `scripts/inventory-legacy-photos.js` — Scaffolding script to inventory Firestore `fishCaught` documents for legacy photo patterns (missing `encryptedMetadata`, presence of `photo` inline data, or `photoPath` using legacy paths). The script is a safe scaffold and requires Firebase configuration / credentials before running in an operator environment.

Notes and operator guidance:
- Live inventory requires Firebase credentials or admin SDK access. The included `scripts/inventory-legacy-photos.js` is a starting point; operators should adapt it to their environment (admin SDK or authenticated client) and run with a dry-run flag.
- Next implementation tasks: implement migration runner (download legacy photos, encrypt, upload, update Firestore) with dry-run and retry modes, and add tests and monitoring.
# Phase 5 — iteration 1: modified files summary

Short list of files changed during Phase 5 iteration 1 (populate after implementation):

- _TBD_

Notes:
- Update this summary once migration work is complete to reflect actual file modifications.
