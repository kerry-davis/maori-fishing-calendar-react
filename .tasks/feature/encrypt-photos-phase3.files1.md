## Summary of modified files for feature/encrypt-photos (phase3)

Below is a short-form list of files modified while implementing the Phase 2 migration improvements and preparing Phase 3 work. Each line includes the file path and a one-line purpose.

- `src/services/photoMigrationService.ts` — Migration orchestration: per-photo outcome reporting, batch processing changes, background runner, retry handling, and accurate progress accounting/persistence.
- `src/test/photoMigrationService.test.ts` — Unit tests for the migration service: expanded Firebase Storage mocks, deterministic crypto.subtle mocks, valid inline photo fixtures, and new tests for init error propagation, processedPhotos accounting, and totals preservation.
- `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase2.files2.md` — Iteration summary (phase2) listing files changed in the first Phase 2 pass.
- `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase2.files3.md` — Iteration summary (phase2) listing files changed in the second pass and test/mocks updates.
- `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase2.files4.md` — Iteration summary (phase2) listing files changed in the final pass (accounting fixes, storage mocks completed).
- `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase3-1.md` — Phase 3 task list and planning file (audit, design, implementation backlog and test/runbook items).

Notes:
- The changes focused on making photo migration deterministic and observable: per-photo outcomes (instead of coarse batch success), improved test coverage with full storage & crypto mocks, and persistence of migration progress.
- Tests updated include additional mocks for `firebase/storage` (e.g., `getMetadata`, `getBlob`, `listAll`) and Web Crypto (`crypto.subtle` methods used by the encryption service).
- Next Phase 3 work should reference this summary when producing detailed PRs (reconciliation utility, UI fixes, telemetry, and full-suite test triage).
