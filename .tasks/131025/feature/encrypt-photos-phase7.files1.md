# Phase 7 — iteration 1: modified files summary


Short list of files changed during Phase 7 iteration 1:

- `src/components/Modals/GalleryModal.tsx` — Updated to robustly detect encrypted photos, async decrypt before rendering, and clean up object URLs.
- `src/components/Modals/FishCatchModal.tsx` — Added loading/placeholder handling, async decryption for encrypted photos, and robust object URL cleanup.

Notes:
- UI now detects encrypted photos and shows loading states while decrypting.
- Object URLs are revoked on cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
- Manual and test verification performed; see test suite for details.

Notes:
- Update this summary once the simplified migration plan or documentation changes are implemented.
