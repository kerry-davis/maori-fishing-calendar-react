# Phase 5 — iteration 2: modified files summary

Short list of files/artefacts added during Phase 5 iteration 2 and brief purpose:

- `scripts/configure-firebase.js` — Helper to initialize Firebase Admin SDK from service account or environment variables. Exits with clear guidance when config is missing.
- `scripts/inventory-legacy-photos.js` — Inventory script with pagination, detection of legacy photo markers, dry-run mode, and JSON/CSV output for operator review.
- `scripts/migrate-legacy-photos.js` — Migration runner scaffold with dry-run option, resumable progress file, and operator-friendly guidance. Needs wiring to `photoEncryptionService` implementation or equivalent logic.

Notes:
- These scripts are intended to be run by operators with admin credentials. They intentionally default to dry-run mode and require explicit credentials to run.
- Next work: implement encryption wiring, add retry and resumable state handling, and add unit/integration tests for script logic.
