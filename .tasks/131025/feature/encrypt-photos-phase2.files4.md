Files changed in this iteration (phase2-4):

1. src/services/photoMigrationService.ts
   - Preserve detected totals: `startMigration` no longer wipes `progress.totalPhotos` after detection; it preserves the detected total number of photos.
   - Minor robustness updates around initialization and saved progress.
2. src/test/photoMigrationService.test.ts
   - Completed the `firebase/storage` mock: added `getMetadata`, `getBlob`, and `listAll` mocks.
   - Adjusted `beforeEach` to return valid metadata/blob/listAll results so decryption paths are exercised.
   - Added test `totalPhotos remains accurate after startMigration`.

Notes:
- Run targeted tests: `npx vitest run src/test/photoMigrationService.test.ts`.
- Consider centralizing storage/crypto mocks in a global test setup file if other tests need similar mocks.
