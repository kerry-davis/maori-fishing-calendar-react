   - **Crypto Mocking**: Added comprehensive crypto.subtle mocking for encryption tests
   - **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors with proper type assertions

## Implementation Details

### Background Migration Features
- **✅ Automatic Detection**: Scans for photos needing migration (missing `encryptedMetadata`)
- **✅ Batch Processing**: Processes 5-10 photos per batch with 30-second time limits
- **✅ Progress Persistence**: Saves progress to localStorage for resume capability
- **✅ Failure Recovery**: Individual photo failures don't stop batch processing
- **✅ User Control**: Pause/resume/cancel functionality with real-time status

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **✅ Dual Status Display**: Shows both data migration and photo migration progress
- **✅ Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking with percentage and ETA
- **✅ Migration Banner**: Clear visual indication of ongoing photo migration
- **✅ Error Display**: Shows failed photo counts and retry options
- **✅ Graceful Fallbacks**: Proper handling of migration failures and edge cases

### Testing Improvements
- **✅ Vitest Compatibility**: All photo encryption tests now use Vitest framework
- **✅ Enhanced Mocking**: Better Firebase and crypto mocking for reliable tests
- **✅ Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for all migration flows
- **✅ Error Scenario Testing**: Tests for failure recovery and retry mechanisms
- **✅ Performance Testing**: Tests for batch processing and memory management

## Verification Results

### Test Execution Status
- **✅ Photo Encryption Tests**: All 7 core tests pass successfully
- **✅ Photo Migration Tests**: New migration service tests implemented
- **✅ Integration Tests**: Enhanced integration testing with proper mocking
- **✅ Build Verification**: TypeScript compilation and production build successful

### Quality Metrics
- **✅ Zero Photo Encryption Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved
- **✅ Enhanced Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of migration flows
- **✅ Improved Performance**: Optimized test execution with modern Vitest framework
- **✅ Better Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with retry mechanisms

## Architecture Overview

### Migration Flow
```
Legacy Photo Detection → Batch Creation → Encryption → Upload → Metadata Storage → Progress Update
     ↓                        ↓            ↓         ↓           ↓                    ↓
  Scan fish records     Group into    Encrypt    Upload to   Store metadata      Update UI
  for unencrypted       5-10 photo    photo data Firebase   in Firestore        with progress
  photos                 batches       with AES-  Storage    fish record
                                     GCM
```

### Service Integration
- **PhotoMigrationService**: Core migration orchestration
- **PhotoEncryptionService**: Binary photo encryption/decryption
- **FirebaseDataService**: Storage and Firestore operations
- **EncryptionMigrationStatus**: UI progress display
- **GalleryModal**: Migration status integration
