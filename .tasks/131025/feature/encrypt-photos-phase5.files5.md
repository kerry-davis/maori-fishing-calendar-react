Short list of files changed during Phase 5 iteration 5:

- `scripts/migrate-legacy-photos.js`        - migration runner: per-user derivation, encryption flagging, contentType, per-user stats
- `scripts/validate-migration-sample.js`   - NEW: validation tool to sample migrated blobs and attempt decryption
- `scripts/inventory-legacy-photos.js`     - cleaned/fixed inventory script (pagination, CSV/JSON output)
- `scripts/configure-firebase.js`          - admin SDK init helper (used by scripts)
- `RUNBOOKS/MIGRATE_LEGACY_PHOTOS.md`      - operator runbook and safety checklist
- `.tasks/long_running_tooling.md`         - notes for running long-running migration tooling safely
