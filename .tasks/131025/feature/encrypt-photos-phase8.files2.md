# Phase 8: Encrypted Photo Preview Integration (Pass 2 Short-form Summary)

**Updated Files:**
- `src/components/Modals/TripLogModal.tsx`: Added `db` to `loadTrips` dependency array for correct memoization; revoked blob URLs before generating new previews in `loadFishCatches` to prevent memory leaks.
- `src/utils/photoPreviewUtils.ts`: Updated `createPlaceholderSVG` to encode SVG string for valid data URIs with any label.

**Notes:**
- Blob URL lifecycle is now robust during reloads.
- SVG placeholders are now always valid regardless of label content.
