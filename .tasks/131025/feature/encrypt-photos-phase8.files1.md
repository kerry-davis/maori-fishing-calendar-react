# Phase 8: Encrypted Photo Preview Integration (Short-form Summary)

**Modified Files:**
- `src/components/Modals/TripLogModal.tsx`: Added encrypted photo preview support using shared utility, passed blob URLs to TripCard, cleaned up object URLs on unmount, updated props.
- `src/utils/photoPreviewUtils.ts`: New shared utility for encrypted photo preview logic (decryption, blob URL, placeholder SVG).

**Shared Logic:**
- TripLogModal, FishCatchModal, and GalleryModal now use the same encrypted photo preview helper for consistent UI and lifecycle cleanup.

**Other Notes:**
- All type and lint errors resolved.
- Unit tests run; only unrelated failures remain.
- Blob URL lifecycle and encrypted photo detection now robust across all modals.
