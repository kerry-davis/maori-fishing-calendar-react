# Phase 3 Tasks for feature/encrypt-photos

1. /home/pulsta/vscode/repo/maori-fishing-calendar-react
2. .tasks/long_running_tooling.md
3. Audit remaining photo storage/decryption flows for Phase 3 scope (e.g., sharing/export, offline cache) and identify gaps.
4. Design Phase 3 feature/UI updates (migration completion UX, analytics, alerts) and capture in specs.
5. Implement prioritized Phase 3 features: analytics/reporting, advanced retry controls, and user notifications for migration status changes.
6. Expand automated tests (unit/integration/E2E) to cover new Phase 3 behaviors and regressions.
7. Prepare migration completion/cleanup scripts or runbooks if required.
8. Run full test suite (`npm test` / `npm run test:run`) and any additional lint/build checks.
9. Create `.tasks/feature/encrypt-photos-phase3.files1.md` summarizing the modified files in short form.
