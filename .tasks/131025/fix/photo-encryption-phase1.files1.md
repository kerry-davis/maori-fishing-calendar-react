# Photo Encryption Phase 1 - Files Modified

## Summary
This document lists all files that were created or modified during the implementation of photo encryption Phase 1.

## Files Created

### Core Services
1. **`src/services/photoEncryptionService.ts`** (214 lines)
   - New service for binary photo encryption/decryption
   - AES-GCM encryption using existing user keys
   - Binary format with magic bytes and metadata
   - SHA-256 integrity verification

## Files Modified

### Core Services
2. **`src/services/firebaseDataService.ts`** (3,069 lines)
   - Added photo encryption service import
   - Modified `ensurePhotoInStorage()` to encrypt new photos
   - Added `getDecryptedPhoto()` method for photo retrieval
   - Added `getBlob` import from Firebase Storage

### Type Definitions
3. **`src/types/index.ts`** (478 lines)
   - Added `encryptedMetadata?: string` field to `FishCaught` interface
   - Updated photo path comments to include encrypted photo paths

### UI Components
4. **`src/components/Modals/GalleryModal.tsx`** (646 lines)
   - Added firebaseDataService import for photo decryption
   - Modified `loadPhotos()` to handle encrypted photo decryption
   - Added automatic decryption with fallback to placeholders
   - Fixed fishId type conversion (string to number)

## Implementation Details

### New Features Added
- **Automatic Photo Encryption**: New photos are encrypted when uploaded if encryption service is ready
- **Photo Decryption**: Gallery can display encrypted photos by decrypting them on-demand
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing unencrypted photos continue to work unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to placeholders if decryption fails

### Integration Points
- **Photo Upload Flow**: FishCatchModal → firebaseDataService → photoEncryptionService → Firebase Storage
- **Photo Display Flow**: GalleryModal → firebaseDataService → photoEncryptionService → Decrypted Display
- **Metadata Storage**: Encryption metadata stored in Firestore `encryptedMetadata` field

### Security Features
- **Key Reuse**: Leverages existing user encryption keys (no additional key management needed)
- **Unique IVs**: Each photo gets a cryptographically secure random initialization vector
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 hash verification ensures decrypted data hasn't been tampered with
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and authenticity guarantees

## File Impact Summary

| File | Change Type | Lines Added | Lines Modified | Purpose |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| `src/services/photoEncryptionService.ts` | Created | 214 | 0 | Core photo encryption logic |
| `src/services/firebaseDataService.ts` | Modified | ~50 | ~20 | Integration with photo encryption |
| `src/types/index.ts` | Modified | 2 | 2 | New metadata field |
| `src/components/Modals/GalleryModal.tsx` | Modified | ~30 | ~10 | Encrypted photo display |

## Next Phase Preparation

These files now contain the foundation for:
- **Phase 2**: Background migration of existing photos
- **Migration UI**: Progress tracking components
- **Emergency Rollback**: Decryption capabilities for crisis recovery

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding encryption capabilities for new photos.
