git commit -m "fix: resolve tide date timezone offset issues

- Remove +24hr workaround from tideService and niwaTideService
- Use Date.UTC() in CalendarGrid for timezone-independent dates  
- Use setUTCHours() in CurrentMoonInfo for tide date
- Add JSDoc documentation explaining UTC requirements
- Add Tide Forecast section header in WeatherForecast

Root cause: Calendar dates were created in local timezone, 
causing off-by-one date errors when UTC components were 
extracted for API calls in different timezones.

The issue manifested as:
- User selects Oct 10 ‚Üí receives tide data for Oct 9
- Problem was worse for timezones far from UTC (NZDT, AEDT)

Solution ensures all calendar dates use UTC midnight, making
date representation consistent regardless of user timezone.

git commit -m "feat: simplify location management and fix dark mode

BREAKING CHANGE: Location search/GPS moved to Settings Modal only

Consolidation:
- Move all location search UI to Settings Modal (GPS + autocomplete)
- Add 'Clear Location' button to Settings
- Remove duplicate search from CurrentMoonInfo (-140 lines)
- Remove duplicate search from LunarModal (-140 lines)
- Add 'Change Location' button to CurrentMoonInfo ‚Üí opens Settings
- Add 'Set Location' button to LunarModal ‚Üí opens Settings
- Pass onSettingsClick from App to both components

Dark Mode Fixes:
- Replace hardcoded #000000 colors with CSS variables in LunarModal
- Use var(--primary-text) for main content
- Use var(--secondary-text) for secondary content
- Match 'Set Location' button styling to 'Change Location' button

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for location management (Settings Modal)
- Removed ~280 lines of duplicate code
- Consistent UX across the app
- Better dark mode visibility
