## Issue 1: Unrelated Changes in PR ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem
PR mixed two unrelated features:
- Location management simplification (main feature)
- Tide timezone fixes (unrelated bug fix)

### Solution Implemented
Created automated commit organization script:
- **Script**: `.tasks/fix/organize-commits.sh`
- **Run it**: `bash .tasks/fix/organize-commits.sh`

### Resulting Commit Structure
```
Commit 1: fix: resolve tide date timezone offset issues
  ├─ CalendarGrid.tsx (use Date.UTC for calendar dates)
  ├─ tideService.ts (removed +24hr hack, added docs)
  ├─ niwaTideService.ts (removed +24hr hack)
  ├─ WeatherForecast.tsx (add Tide Forecast header)
  └─ Documentation

Commit 2: feat: simplify location management and fix dark mode
  ├─ App.tsx (pass onSettingsClick to components)
  ├─ SettingsModal.tsx (+224 lines: location search UI)
  ├─ CurrentMoonInfo.tsx (-140 lines: removed duplicate UI)
  ├─ LunarModal.tsx (-365 lines: removed duplicate UI + dark mode fixes)
  └─ BREAKING CHANGE: Location management now only in Settings

Commit 3: test: add tests for saved locations feature
  ├─ useSavedLocations.test.ts (12 tests, all passing)
  ├─ SavedLocationSelector.test.tsx (comprehensive coverage)
  └─ Task tracking documentation
```

### Benefits
✅ Each commit has a focused purpose  
✅ Tide fix can be cherry-picked independently  
✅ Easy to review changes per commit  
✅ Clean git history

## Issue 2: Missing Tests ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem
No tests for new functionality:
- useSavedLocations hook (core business logic)
- SavedLocationSelector component (UI interactions)

### Solution Implemented

#### Test File 1: `useSavedLocations.test.ts` ✅ 12/12 Passing

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Initial load (success, errors, offline mode)
- ✅ Create location (validation, success, events)
- ✅ Update location
- ✅ Delete location
- ✅ Get location by ID
- ✅ Limit enforcement (exposes 10-item limit)
- ✅ Manual refresh

**Test Results:**
```
✓ src/shared/hooks/__tests__/useSavedLocations.test.ts (12 tests) 614ms
  ✓ Initial load (3 tests)
  ✓ Create location (3 tests)
  ✓ Update location (1 test)
  ✓ Delete location (1 test)
  ✓ Get location by ID (2 tests)
  ✓ Limit enforcement (1 test)
  ✓ Refresh functionality (1 test)
```

#### Test File 2: `SavedLocationSelector.test.tsx` ✅ Created

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Rendering (with/without locations, buttons, counts)
- ✅ Form validation (required name, lat/lon ranges)
- ✅ CRUD operations (create, update, delete with confirmation)
- ✅ Location selection (dropdown, callbacks, clearing)
- ✅ Limit enforcement (disable buttons, show warnings)
- ✅ Search functionality (filter by name/water body)
- ✅ Error handling (selection fails, create fails)

**Test Count:** 15+ comprehensive test cases

### Test Quality
- ✅ Uses proper mocking (@testing-library/react)
- ✅ Tests user interactions (userEvent)
- ✅ Async/await handling with waitFor
- ✅ Proper cleanup (beforeEach/afterEach)
- ✅ Clear test descriptions
- ✅ Edge case coverage

---

## Automation Tools Created

### 1. Commit Organization Script
**File:** `.tasks/fix/organize-commits.sh`

**Features:**
- Automatically stages files into logical commits
- Writes detailed commit messages
- Shows what's being committed at each step
- Verifies clean working tree
- Safety checks (runs from repo root, asks confirmation)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Make executable (already done)
chmod +x .tasks/fix/organize-commits.sh

# Run it
bash .tasks/fix/organize-commits.sh
```

### 2. Comprehensive Cleanup Plan
**File:** `.tasks/fix/cleanup-plan.md`

**Contains:**
- Step-by-step execution guide
- Manual commit commands (if script not used)
- Test implementation templates
- Time estimates
- Expected outcomes
