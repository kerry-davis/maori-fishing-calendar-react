## New Collections Documented

### userSavedLocations (Firestore)

**Schema:**
```typescript
{
  id: string              // Firestore document ID
  userId: string          // Owner FK
  name: string            // Encrypted
  water?: string          // Encrypted (optional)
  location?: string       // Encrypted (optional)
  lat?: number            // Optional coordinates
  lon?: number            // Optional coordinates
  notes?: string          // Encrypted (optional)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Security Rules:**
```javascript
match /userSavedLocations/{document} {
  allow create: if isOwnerRequest();
  allow read, update, delete: if isOwnerResource();
}
```

**Indexes:**
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "userSavedLocations",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "userId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

### savedLocations (localStorage - Guest Mode)

**Storage Key:** `savedLocations`

**Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "ulid-string",
    "name": "My Favorite Spot",
    "water": "Ocean",
    "location": "Beach Name",
    "lat": -36.8485,
    "lon": 174.7633,
    "notes": "Best at high tide",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-26T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Feature Constraints Documented

### 10-Location Limit
- Hard cap enforced at service level
- Applies to both authenticated and guest users
- Error thrown when limit exceeded: "Cannot save more than 10 locations"

### Duplicate Prevention
- 11-meter coordinate tolerance (0.0001 degrees)
- Checks existing locations before creation
- Error thrown: "A location at these coordinates already exists: {name}"

### Encryption
- Fields encrypted: name, water, location, notes
- Non-encrypted: id, userId, lat, lon, timestamps
- Same deterministic encryption as other collections

---

## Event-Driven Updates

**Event Name:** `savedLocationsChanged`

**Emitted On:**
- Create saved location
- Update saved location
- Delete saved location

**Listeners:**
- `useSavedLocations` hook
- Triggers UI refresh across all components

---

## UI Integration Points Documented

### Settings Modal
- Primary management interface
- Dropdown selector with search
- Create/Edit/Delete functionality
- "Save Current Location" button
- 10-location limit display

### LocationContext
- App-wide access to saved locations state

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ **Build successful**
```bash
$ npm run build:skip-types
✓ built in 5.15s
Bundle size: 1133.76 KB
```

### Documentation Consistency
✅ All mentions of collections now include `userSavedLocations`
✅ All mentions of encryption now include saved locations fields
✅ Feature table in README updated
✅ ERDs show proper relationships
✅ Service layer documentation matches implementation

---

## Cross-References

All documentation properly cross-references:
- README → DATA_MODEL.md → SECURITY.md
- DATA_MODEL.md sections internally consistent
- Service layer docs match actual implementation
- UI data model reflects actual component structure

---

## Files NOT Updated (Intentionally)

### Why Not Updated:

1. **OVERVIEW.md** - High-level architecture only, no collection details
2. **TECH_STACK.md** - Technology choices only, no feature details
3. **ROADMAP.md** - Future plans, not current features
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Will be updated at release time
5. **TESTING.md** - No new test patterns introduced
6. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - No known issues yet

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Documentation complete** - All applicable docs updated
2. [ ] **Manual review** - Review rendered Mermaid diagrams in GitHub
3. [ ] **Changelog entry** - Add to CHANGELOG.md when cutting release
4. [ ] **User-facing docs** - Consider adding saved locations to user guide (if exists)
