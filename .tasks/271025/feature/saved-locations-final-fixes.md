# Saved Locations - Final Fixes

## Date: 2025-10-26

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mount Tracking Bug - Component Stuck in Loading State
**Problem**: The hook successfully loaded saved locations but the UI remained stuck showing "Loading saved locations..." forever.

**Root Cause**: React Strict Mode in development causes components to unmount and remount. The `mountedRef` was set to `true` once on initialization, then set to `false` on unmount, but **never reset to `true`** on remount. This caused all async state updates to be skipped.

**Solution**: Reset `mountedRef.current = true` in the useEffect mount phase:

```typescript
// src/shared/hooks/useSavedLocations.ts
useEffect(() => {
  mountedRef.current = true;  // ← Reset on every mount
  return () => {
    mountedRef.current = false;  // ← Cleanup on unmount
  };
}, []);
```

### 2. Duplicate Location Prevention
**Problem**: Users could save the same location multiple times.

**Solution**: Added duplicate detection in `createSavedLocation()` for both authenticated and guest users:

```typescript
// Check for duplicate coordinates (within 0.0001 degree tolerance ~11 meters)
if (typeof sanitized.lat === 'number' && typeof sanitized.lon === 'number') {
  const duplicate = current.find((loc) => {
    if (typeof loc.lat === 'number' && typeof loc.lon === 'number') {
      const latDiff = Math.abs(loc.lat - sanitized.lat);
      const lonDiff = Math.abs(loc.lon - sanitized.lon);
      return latDiff < 0.0001 && lonDiff < 0.0001;
    }
    return false;
  });

  if (duplicate) {
    throw new Error(`A location at these coordinates already exists: "${duplicate.name}"`);
  }
}
```

**Tolerance**: 0.0001 degrees ≈ 11 meters (appropriate for location uniqueness)

### 3. Settings Modal Auto-Matching Removal
**Problem**: The dropdown automatically selected a saved location if it matched the current userLocation coordinates or name.

**Solution**: Removed auto-matching logic from SettingsModal. The dropdown now only shows a selection when explicitly chosen by the user.

```typescript
// Removed this useEffect that was auto-matching:
useEffect(() => {
  const match = savedLocations.find((location) => {
    // coordinate/name matching logic
  });
  setSelectedSavedLocationId(match?.id ?? '');
}, [userLocation, savedLocations]);
```

**Result**: Dropdown is empty until user explicitly selects from list.

### 4. Error Message Leak to Settings Modal
**Problem**: When creating a duplicate location failed in the "Save Current Location" modal, the error persisted and displayed below the dropdown in SettingsModal after closing the form.

**Root Cause**: The SavedLocationSelector component displayed both `selectorError` (for selection/deletion errors) and `savedLocationsError` (from the hook, which includes form submission errors).

**Solution**: Only display `selectorError` (selection/deletion errors), not `savedLocationsError` (creation/update errors should only appear in the form):

```typescript
// Before:
{(savedLocationsError || selectorError) && (
  <p className="text-sm" style={{ color: 'var(--error-text)' }}>
    {selectorError || savedLocationsError}
  </p>
)}

// After:
{selectorError && (
  <p className="text-sm" style={{ color: 'var(--error-text)' }}>
    {selectorError}
  </p>
)}
```

**Result**: Form errors stay in the form, selector errors stay in the selector area.

## Files Modified

1. **src/shared/hooks/useSavedLocations.ts**
   - Fixed mount tracking bug
   - Added comprehensive logging

2. **src/shared/services/firebaseDataService.ts**
   - Removed overlay cache complexity
   - Simplified getSavedLocations()
   - Added duplicate detection for authenticated users
   - Added duplicate detection for guest users
   - Added comprehensive logging

3. **src/features/locations/SavedLocationSelector.tsx**
   - Fixed error display (only show selectorError, not savedLocationsError)
   - Added logging for debugging

4. **src/app/providers/LocationContext.tsx**
   - Added logging for debugging

5. **src/features/modals/SettingsModal.tsx**
   - Removed auto-matching logic
   - Dropdown now only shows explicit selections

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Save Current Location creates new saved location
- [x] Saved locations appear in dropdown immediately after creation
- [x] Dropdown not stuck in "Loading saved locations..." state
- [x] Cannot save duplicate locations at same coordinates
- [x] Duplicate error shows in form modal, not below dropdown
- [x] Settings dropdown is empty until user selects from list
- [x] Selected location persists in dropdown until changed
- [x] Guest mode duplicate detection works
- [x] Authenticated mode duplicate detection works

## Behavior Summary

### Duplicate Detection
- **Tolerance**: 0.0001 degrees (~11 meters)
- **Error Message**: "A location at these coordinates already exists: {name}"
- **Display**: Only in the form modal, never below the dropdown

### Settings Modal Dropdown
- **Initial State**: Empty (no selection)
- **Selection**: Only when user explicitly chooses from dropdown
- **Persistence**: Selection persists until user changes it or clears it
- **No Auto-Matching**: Current location doesn't auto-select a saved location

### Error Handling
- **Form errors**: Displayed only in the form modal (red box at top)
- **Selector errors**: Displayed below dropdown (selection/deletion failures)
- **Separation**: Form submission errors never leak to selector area

## Build Status
✅ Build successful (`npm run build:skip-types`)

## Clean-Up Recommendations (Future)

Once feature is verified working in production:
1. Remove all `console.log()` statements from SavedLocationSelector.tsx
2. Remove all `console.log()` statements from LocationContext.tsx
3. Remove all `console.log()` statements from useSavedLocations.ts
4. Keep `DEV_LOG()` and `PROD_ERROR()` statements in firebaseDataService.ts (useful for production debugging)
