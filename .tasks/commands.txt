4. Initial plan

5. Try something else
use for context only @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md ;  Previous solutions are still not working. Think harder and approach the problem from a different angle to implement a cleaner solution. Do not overcomplicate; keep the solution simple and straightforward. After you complete your implementation, validate the changes with a brief summary of the new solution and its rationale. If the solution does not address the core issue, iterate with a revised approach.

6. Update docs
please update @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md and any other applicable docs with the changes made in the branch
