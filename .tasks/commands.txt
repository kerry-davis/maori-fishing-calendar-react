1. planner
phase 4: 
please create .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md with a set of tasks to be done in a seq. order to address your investigations. 
the first item should be the project path eg. /home/pulsta/vscode/repo/maori-fishing-calendar-react
the second item should be .tasks/long_running_tooling.md
the last item is to create file .tasks/[branch name].[files][increment number].md with a list in short form the files changed 

2. worker
a new set of tasks have been provided .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md please implement. 
do not stop until complete.

3. planner
tasks complete. please review the code that was completed in these files .tasks/[branch name].[files][increment number].md and provide feedback.

4. Initial plan
please save plan to file .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md; please note that if the branch name has a "/" you are required to create a subdirectory.

5. Try something else
use for context only @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md ;  Previous solutions are still not working. 
Think harder and approach the problem from a different angle to implement a cleaner solution. 
Do not overcomplicate; keep the solution simple and straightforward. 
After you complete your implementation, validate the changes with a brief summary of the new solution and its rationale. 
If the solution does not address the core issue, iterate with a revised approach.

6. Code review
please review all changes on this branch and provide feedback

6. Update docs
please update @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md and any other applicable docs with the changes made in the branch

7. KISS
KISS and DO NOT EVER CLEAR ANY LOGIC THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO FIX AN ISSUE UNLESS I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO DO SO

8. Build
Always run a build and fix any errors.

9. UI

9a. UI Enhancement
**Objective:**  
Make the current design look more unique and less basic by incorporating sleek fonts and enhancing overall visual appeal.

---

**Requirements:**

- Use sophisticated and modern fonts that elevate the interface’s style.
- Introduce design elements that bring uniqueness without overwhelming the user.
- Focus on creating a beautiful and polished user experience that stands out.
- Balance aesthetics with usability to maintain clarity and functionality.

---

**Output:**  
Provide design suggestions, font recommendations, and style tips that transform the UI into a more elegant, visually captivating solution.

9b. UI Research - Tailwind CSS V4 UI Modernization (Ray Fernando)
**Objective:**  
Research and recommend approaches to modernize the app UI by upgrading from a basic interface to one using the Tailwind CSS V4 design and tokenization system.

---

**Requirements:**

- Explore different UI design styles and theme systems, focusing on the transition to Tailwind CSS V4 and its built-in design token features.
- Implement both light mode and dark mode, ensuring seamless toggling and consistent application of design tokens and theme variables.
- Integrate font customization and variations using Tailwind’s V4 mechanisms for font and style tokens.
- Redesign the user interface to feature a [Style] vibe—applying suitable colors, components, and visuals in harmony with Tailwind V4 principles.
- Support best practices for search UX (using `ref` for search components) and advanced code patterns (such as using exa code mcps for code presentation and maintainability).

---

**Output:**  
Deliver a summary of recommended design systems, relevant Tailwind V4 features, practical code samples, and actionable tips for lighting, theming, fonts, and smooth search/code integration. Reference up-to-date resources and Tailwind V4 documentation.

9c. UI Minimalist, Hierarchical Design (Ray Fernando)
**Objective:**  
Redesign the site to minimize excessive colors and display a subtle, tasteful hierarchy of information, following Dieter Rams' key design principles.

---

**Requirements:**

- Limit color usage. Only use color purposefully, where it helps usability and clarity, in accordance with "less, but better" thinking.
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy, prioritizing clarity and subtle presentation over flashy effects.
- Approach design from the viewpoint of three distinct personas:
    1. The user (focused on day-to-day usability)
    2. The admin (needs clear, efficient site management)
    3. The information seeker (wants fast, accurate navigation)
- Analyze these personas’ psychology and needs to organize layout, interactions, and content accordingly.

---

**Output:**  
Explain how careful design hierarchy and restrained color choices improve user experience for each persona. Give specific examples of subtle, well-considered design treatments, and list practical ideas for applying Dieter Rams’ principles and for serving each user type’s priorities.
