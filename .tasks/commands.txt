1. planner
phase 4: 
please create .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md with a set of tasks to be done in a seq. order to address your investigations. 
the first item should be the project path eg. /home/pulsta/vscode/repo/maori-fishing-calendar-react
the second item should be .tasks/long_running_tooling.md
the last item is to create file .tasks/[branch name].[files][increment number].md with a list in short form the files changed 

2. worker
a new set of tasks have been provided .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md please implement. 
do not stop until complete.

3. planner
tasks complete. please review the code that was completed in these files .tasks/[branch name].[files][increment number].md and provide feedback.

4. Initial plan
please save plan to file .tasks/[branch name][increment number].md; please note that if the branch name has a "/" you are required to create a subdirectory.

5. Try something else
use for context only @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md ;  Previous solutions are still not working. 
Think harder and approach the problem from a different angle to implement a cleaner solution. 
Do not overcomplicate; keep the solution simple and straightforward. 
After you complete your implementation, validate the changes with a brief summary of the new solution and its rationale. 
If the solution does not address the core issue, iterate with a revised approach.

6. Code review
please review all changes on this branch and provide feedback

6. Update docs
please update @docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md and any other applicable docs with the changes made in the branch

KISS
7. KISS and DO NOT EVER CLEAR ANY LOGIC THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO FIX AN ISSUE UNLESS I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO DO SO
