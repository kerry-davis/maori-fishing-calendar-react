# Files Changed - NIWA Environment Variable Alignment

## Environment Variables Modified
- `.env` - Removed client-side `VITE_NIWA_API_KEY`, kept only `VITE_NIWA_PROXY_URL`
- `.env.example` - Updated with proper client/server separation and security notes

## Core Service Files Modified  
- `src/services/niwaTideService.ts` - Removed client-side API key dependency, enhanced graceful degradation
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated development proxy configuration with error handling

## Key Security & Architecture Changes

### Environment Variable Separation
- **Client**: `VITE_NIWA_PROXY_URL=/api/niwa-tides` (tells client where to send requests)
- **Server**: `NIWA_API_KEY=your_key` (server-only environment variable)

### Security Improvements  
- API key now only exposed to serverless proxy, never to browser
- Client no longer requires or has access to NIWA API credentials
- All API key handling moved server-side for maximum security

### Graceful Degradation
- When proxy unavailable: NIWA provider automatically disabled
- Seamless fallback to Open-Meteo without user interruption
- Clear error logging for development troubleshooting

### Development/Production Alignment
- **Production**: Uses Vercel serverless at `/api/niwa-tides`
- **Development**: Vite proxy attempts NIWA API, falls back gracefully
- Both environments provide consistent fallback behavior

## Implementation Status
✅ Client-side key requirement removed
✅ Server-side proxy configured with environment variable  
✅ Graceful degradation implemented
✅ Development/production workflows verified
