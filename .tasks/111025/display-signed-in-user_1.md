1. /home/pulsta/vscode/repo/maori-fishing-calendar-react â€“ Confirm you are operating from the repository root and verify required environment variables, Firebase credentials, and local configuration files are available before making any changes.
2. Review the current authentication flow by inspecting `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, associated hooks, and Firebase service interactions to understand how the signed-in user is persisted and exposed to the UI.
3. Audit the components responsible for rendering user-facing UI, especially `src/App.tsx` and related navigation or header components, to locate where the signed-in user information should be surfaced.
4. Design the approach for displaying the signed-in user, identifying necessary props, context consumers, and UI elements, and outline any additional state management or formatting requirements.
5. Implement the code changes to fetch and display the active user in the identified UI components, ensuring consistency with existing coding patterns, accessibility considerations, and localization if present.
6. Execute the relevant unit, integration, and end-to-end tests (e.g., Vitest and Cypress suites) to validate the new signed-in user display, and resolve any regressions or linting issues uncovered during testing.
7. Create `.tasks/display-signed-in-user_1.files.md` with a concise list (without added commentary) of every file modified or created during this task sequence to maintain accurate change tracking.
