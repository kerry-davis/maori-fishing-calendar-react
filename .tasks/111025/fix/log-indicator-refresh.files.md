# Modified Files for Log Indicator Refresh Implementation

## Core Implementation Files
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added `userDataReady` state and emit refresh signals when user data is ready
- `src/components/Calendar/Calendar.tsx` - Added listener for `userDataReady` events to refresh trip indicators

## Test Files
- `src/test/userDataReadyEventIntegration.test.ts` - Integration tests for userDataReady event mechanism
- `src/test/calendarIndicatorRefresh.test.ts` - Calendar refresh behavior simulation tests

## Key Changes Summary

### AuthContext
- Added `userDataReady: boolean` to ensure user-specific data loading completion
- Emits `userDataReady` custom event when background data operations complete after login
- Supports both authenticated user and guest mode scenarios
- Includes error handling for failed background operations

### Calendar Component  
- Added event listener for `userDataReady` custom events
- Automatically refreshes trip indicators when user data becomes available
- Includes detailed logging for debugging calendar refresh behavior
- Properly typed TypeScript CustomEvent handling

### Test Coverage
- Event dispatching and listening mechanism (6 tests)
- Calendar refresh behavior simulation (5 tests)
- Event payload validation with different scenarios (user, guest, error)
- Multiple listener support and cleanup verification
- Error handling and graceful degradation

## Test Results
- All 11 integration tests pass successfully
- Comprehensive coverage of event-driven refresh flow
- Validates login, logout, error, and guest mode scenarios
