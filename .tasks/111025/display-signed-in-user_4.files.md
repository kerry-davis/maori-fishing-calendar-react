## Modified Files

### src/components/Layout/Header.tsx
**Changes:**
- Refactored to lightweight authentication UI approach
- Removed state: `email`, `password`, `isRegister`, `authError`, `authLoading`
- Added state: `showLoginModal` (boolean)
- Desktop dropdown now shows:
  - User identity with icon (always visible)
  - "Signed in" / "Not signed in" status
  - Single action button: "Sign Out" (authenticated) or "Sign In" (guest)
  - Firebase not configured message with helpful guidance
- Mobile menu now shows:
  - User identity with icon at top
  - Single action button matching authentication state
  - Reduced max-height from 600px to 96 (24rem)
- Removed functions: `handleEmailPasswordSubmit`, `handleGoogleSignIn`
- Updated `handleSignOut`: closes both dropdown and mobile menu
- Added `handleSignInClick`: closes menus and opens LoginModal
- Re-integrated `LoginModal` component for full authentication forms
- Modal automatically closes on successful authentication
- Mobile menu closes when modal opens
- State management cleaned up - form state entirely in LoginModal
- Proper separation of concerns: Header shows state, Modal handles authentication

## Summary
Completed refactoring of Header component to use a lightweight authentication UI. The header now only displays user identity and provides simple action buttons, while delegating all authentication form logic to the LoginModal component. This creates a cleaner separation of concerns and improves the user experience with a simpler, more focused header interface.
